Summary
*Echinococcus multilocularis* is the etiological agent of alveolar echinococcosis (AE), a serious parasitic disease in the Northern Hemisphere. The *E. multilocularis* primary cell cultivation system, together with *E. multilocularis* genome data and a range of pioneering molecular-based tools have advanced the research on this and other cestodes. In particular, RNA Interference (RNAi) and microRNA knock-down have recently contributed to the study of the cellular and molecular basis of tapeworm development and host-parasite interaction. These, as well as other techniques, normally involve an electroporation step for the delivery of RNA, DNA, peptides, and small molecules into cells. Using transcriptome data and bioinformatic analyses we herein report a genome-wide comparison between primary cells of *E. multilocularis* and primary cells under electroporated conditions after 48 h of culture. We observed that ~15% of genes showed a significant variation in expression level, including highly upregulated genes in electroporated cells, putatively involved in detoxification and membrane remodeling. Furthermore, we found genes related to carbohydrate metabolism, proteolysis, calcium ion binding and microtubule processing significantly altered, which could explain the cellular dispersion and the reduced formation of cellular aggregates observed during the first 48 hours after electroporation.
